# 🏡 House Price Prediction (Indore)

This project predicts **house prices in Indore** using **Machine Learning** and provides an interactive dashboard built with **Streamlit**.  
The model is trained on a **synthetic dataset** that includes localities like Vijay Nagar, Palasia, Rau, Bhawarkua, etc.

---

## 📌 Features
- Predict house prices based on:
  - Number of Bedrooms 🛏️
  - Number of Bathrooms 🚿
  - Area (sq. ft) 📐
  - Age of House (years) ⏳
  - Location Score (1-10) 📍
- Interactive **Streamlit Web App**
- Visual Dashboard with:
  - Price Distribution
  - Area vs Price Scatter Plot
  - Feature Correlation Heatmap

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for graphs)
